# Concordia_Course_Builder
Group Assignment for SOEN 341, where we make a much better version of the course builder!

## Contributing and Making Branches 
- Members of The Procrastinators team have collaboration rights. We follow the below version control system:

### Master (master) branch
- Requires at least 1 reviewer to merge into. This is for version releases.

### Feature Branches
- The work associated with a user story should at first be uniquely tied to a feature branch containing its ID number. This makes it much easier to tie PRs to a feature 

## Issue Tracking for Project Management
- Work is done through assigning team members to issues, that can be either Issues (non-code related items) or UserStories (code-related items). The assigned member should take ownership of the issue they are assigned to, and either complete the issue, or pass the assignee-ownership to other members after contributing. 
- Projects track the current Sprint, and the current status of Issues (either To-Do, In-Progress, or Done). 

## Project Wiki
- For information such as the team member contact information, tools used, guides, and other fun stuff, please refer to this project's wiki on Github
