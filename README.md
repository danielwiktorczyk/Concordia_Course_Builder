The Course_Database_Table.csv file should be used to populate the Course repository with SOEN, ENGR, ENCS, COMP and ELEC 275 classes.

Most of the data is pretty self explainatory just a couple of notes:
association is a unique 4 digit integer that a course shares with it's associated tutorials, labs are not associated with particular classes so any lad for that class in that semester will do
requireEngineer has three possible values "NOENG" indicates a course that does not have to be taught by an engineer, 
"Y" indicates a course that does have to be taught by an engineer and is taught by one, 
"N" indicates a course that does have to be taught by an engineer and is not. 
startTime and endTime are an integer in minutes from midnight at which the course starts and ends
